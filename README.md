#### Frontend part of the pizzeria online store. I did this project during a 30 hour React course. While working on the project, I gained skills in working with hooks and components in ReactJS. Make adaptive layout, create pages, sort, search, paginate, filter, popup windows, etc, interact with the server part, send requests to the backend. develop page navigation without reloading. create a global data store for the entire application using the Redux Toolkit, work with LocalStorage to store site settings, optimize component redraws/renders, code splitting
